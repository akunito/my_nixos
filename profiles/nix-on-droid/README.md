# Nix-on-Droid Profile

I need Emacs on the go!

This is the Nix on Droid profile, which is a minimal installation used on Android. This (obviously) requires [nix-on-droid](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid) to be installed.

## Features

Essentially just use this for:
- Emacs
- Some CLI apps
