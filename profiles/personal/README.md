# Personal Profile

Just chillin'

This is my profile for a personal computer. It is functionally identical to my [work](../work) profile, but includes extra things like games and social apps!

I also added:

```nix
../../system/hardware/drives.nix # To mount my secondary drives
```

**⚠️ Warning**: It might fail if the drive is NOT FOUND!!!

Disable or adjust it if needed.
