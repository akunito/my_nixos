# Personal Profile

Just chillin'

This is the profile for a personal computer. It is functionally identical to the [work](../work/README.md) profile, but includes extra things like games and social apps!

## Additional Features

This profile also includes:
- `../../system/hardware/drives.nix` - To mount secondary drives

**Important**: It might fail if the drive is NOT FOUND! Disable or adjust it if needed.
