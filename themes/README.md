# My Themes

Inside this directory are all of my themes!

Each theme directory stores a few relevant files:

- `${theme-name}.yaml` - This stores all 16 colors for the theme
- `backgroundurl.txt` - A direct link to the wallpaper associated with the theme
- `backgroundsha256.txt` - SHA256 sum of the wallpaper
- `polarity.txt` - Whether or not the background is `light` or `dark`
- `${theme-name}.png` - A screenshot of the theme for previewing purposes

Look at any of the directories here for more info!
