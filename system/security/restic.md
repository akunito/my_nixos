# Introduction
Restic is a modern software to manage incremental backups using repositories

We use it to backup home directory
We use systemD to backup periodically

# Installation
#### 1. Add restic package to system packages
In our project we add these on `flake.PROFILE.nix`

```sh
	systemSettings = {
		...
        # System packages
        systemPackages = [
          pkgs.nfs-utils
          pkgs.restic # Add Restic here
        ];
        systemStateVersion = "24.05";
    };
```
#### 2. Run `install.sh` to apply changes

```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh ~/.dotfiles "PROFILE"
```

# Restic binary wrapper
This configuration tightens security while allowing `restic` to perform backups with elevated permissions. The wrapper ensures that:

- The binary is accessible only to the given user, in our example (`aga`).
- It has just enough system-level permissions (via capabilities) to perform backups.
- Others cannot misuse or tamper with it.

What is `cap_dac_read_search` ?

- `cap_dac_read_search` allows the binary to bypass **file read and directory search permission checks**, even if the user lacks read or search permissions for specific files or directories.
- This capability is useful for `restic` to back up files and directories that are not directly accessible to the user due to strict permissions.
#### 1. Config `restic.nix`
To create the restic user and setup the wrapper

> You can check the paths by `$ which restic`
> Or by `$ ll /run/current-system/sw/bin/`

```sh
{ lib, userSettings, systemSettings, pkgs, authorizedKeys ? [], ... }:

{
  # Create restic user
  users.users.restic = {
    isNormalUser = true;
  };
  # Wrapper for restic
  security.wrappers.restic = {
    source = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/restic";
    owner = userSettings.username; # Sets the owner of the restic binary (rwx)
    group = "wheel"; # Sets the group of the restic binary (none)
    permissions = "u=rwx,g=,o="; # Permissions of the restic binary
    capabilities = "cap_dac_read_search=+ep"; # Sets the capabilities of the restic binary
  };
  ...
}
```

# Sudo setup for Restic binary
We will config sudo NOPASSWD and SETENV for the Restic binary wrapper, for the given user
So we don't have to use sudo password when our user uses our Restic wrapper

#### 1. Adjust the commands for sudo on `flake.PROFILE.nix` 

```sh
	systemSettings = {
		...
        sudoNOPASSWD = true; # for allowing sudo without password (NOT Recommended, check sudo.md for more info)
        sudoCommands = [
        {
          command = "/run/wrappers/bin/restic"; # config Restic wrapper
          options = [ "NOPASSWD" "SETENV" ];
        }
        {
          command = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/restic"; # same for no wrapper binary
          options = [ "NOPASSWD" "SETENV" ];
        }];
        ...
    };
```

#### 2. Config `sudo.nix`  that grab the previous variables and set sudo
`sudo.nix` must be sourced into the right `configuration.nix` of the profile you are trying to set

```sh
  security.sudo = {
    enable = systemSettings.sudoEnable;
    extraRules = lib.mkIf (systemSettings.sudoNOPASSWD == true) [{
      users = [ "${userSettings.username}" ];
      # groups = [ "wheel" ];
      commands = systemSettings.sudoCommands;
    }];
    extraConfig = with pkgs; ''
      Defaults:picloud secure_path="${lib.makeBinPath [
        systemd
      ]}:/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin"
    '';
  };
```

# Restic repository password
TODO: This is to be improved with some Secret manager

By the moment we created a root file with the password for the repository

```sh
KEYPATH=~/Sync/.maintenance/passwords/
FILENAME=restic.key
FULLPATH="$KEYPATH""$FILENAME"

mkdir -p $KEYPATH
sudo nano $FULLPATH # Add your password to the file
# Make sure the permissions are set
sudo chown root:root $FULLPATH
sudo chmod 600 $FULLPATH
ll $FULLPATH
```

# SystemD service
Create a service that periodically run a script to perform the backup

##### 1. Add the variables to `flake.PROFILE.nix` 
Using flake profiles we can adjust our setup to different computers / users, while our nix module remains the same and usable for everyone.

In our example we create a service that:
- runs every 6 hours 
- for the user aga
- execute by sh the script on the given path
```sh
	systemSettings = {
		...
        # Backups
        homeBackupEnable = true; # restic.nix
        homeBackupDescription = "Backup Home Directory with Restic";
        homeBackupExecStart = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/sh /home/aga/myScripts/agalaptop_backup.sh";
        homeBackupUser = "aga";
        homeBackupTimerDescription = "Timer for home_backup service";
        homeBackupOnCalendar = "*-*-* 0/6:00:00"; # Every 6 hours
        ...
    };
```

##### 2. Add the service to restic.nix
Which will grab the variables from the flake

```sh
  ...
  systemd.services.home_backup = lib.mkIf (systemSettings.homeBackupEnable == true) {
    description = systemSettings.homeBackupDescription;
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "simple";
      ExecStart = systemSettings.homeBackupExecStart;
      User = systemSettings.homeBackupUser;
      Environment = "PATH=/run/current-system/sw/bin:/usr/bin:/bin";
    };
  };
  systemd.timers.home_backup = lib.mkIf (systemSettings.homeBackupEnable == true) {
    description = systemSettings.homeBackupTimerDescription;
    wantedBy = [ "timers.target" ];
    timerConfig = {
      OnCalendar = systemSettings.homeBackupOnCalendar; # Every 6 hours
      Persistent = true;
    };
  };
  ...
```

# Script sample
Note that we use the wrapper path `/run/wrappers/bin/restic`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "======================== Local Backup for Agalaptop =========================="
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY="/home/aga/Sync/.maintenance/Backups/"
export RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE="/home/aga/Sync/.maintenance/passwords/restic.key"

```


# Copy the repository to a remote NFS drive

As we copy to a NFS, the files owned by root will be owned by the user in the NFS.
This is because NFS is moutned with squash_root, which maps root to nobody for security reasons.
To ignore the errors, we avoid copying owner and group.

-a is equivalent to -rlptgoD so we remove the o and g.
-v is for verbose
-P is for progress
--delete is to delete files in the destination that are not in the source
--delete-excluded is to delete files in the destination that are excluded in the source

```sh
#!/bin/sh
