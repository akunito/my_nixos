* How to mount your LUKS devices automatically
1. Add the UUID to the boot.initrd.luks.devices as below.
2. Install.sh and Reboot the system. The device should be now unlocked on /dev/mapper
3. Create the directory: $ mkdir -p /mnt/DATA_4TB
4. Mount it: $ sudo mount /dev/mapper/DATA_4TB /mnt/DATA_4TB
5. The device should be now mounted. 
    When you install.sh again, the device is added automatically to hardware-configuration.nix
    If you try to add it manually on configuration.nix or here, there will be conflicts probably.
