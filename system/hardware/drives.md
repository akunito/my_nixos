* How to mount your LUKS devices automatically

0. The drive needs to be already formated, LUKS partition created and assigned, so you can see it at /dev/mapper/partition_name
My guides: Create LUKS Ext4 partition
My guides: Format drive bigger than 2Tb

1. Add the UUID to the boot.initrd.luks.devices to your configuration.nix (drives.nix module).
    This is now done on flake.PROFILE.nix by variables. Adjust it accordingly together with drives.nix

    ```sh
    # To get general info
    sudo fdisk -l

    # To get the UUID
    sudo blkid
    ```

2. Run the install.sh script and Reboot the system. The device should be now unlocked on /dev/mapper

3. Create the directory/es, ie:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p /mnt/DATA_4TB
    mkdir -p /mnt/Machines
    mkdir -p /mnt/TimeShift
    ```

4. Mount it/them, ie:
    ```sh
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/DATA_4TB /mnt/DATA_4TB
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/Machines /mnt/Machines
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/TimeShift /mnt/TimeShift
    ```

5. The device should be now mounted. 
    When you install.sh again, the device is added automatically to hardware-configuration.nix
    If you try to add it manually on configuration.nix or here, there will be conflicts probably.
